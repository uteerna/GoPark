	<p> <h2 class="maintext myclass">  Managing traffic on campus </h2> </p>
	<div class="myclass padright" style ="text-align: justify;"> <p> The Office of Parking Operations exists to make sure traffic flows efficiently on the IU Bloomington campus, and to provide parking facilities for faculty, staff, students, and visitors. 
	We are self-supporting and receive no funds from the state of Indiana, the university budget, or student fees. All income generated by the sale of parking permits and from citations is used for the administration, maintenance, and improvement of parking facilities. 
	IU reserves the right to temporarily close any campus parking area or facility, or to change which permits are allowed in particular parking areas. Any changes will be announced in a variety of media. 
	Any verbal or physical abuse directed at parking employees—including threats, cursing, or assault—will be reported to the appropriate university authorities for disciplinary action. </p>  </div>
